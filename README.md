## Overview

The **Kwanza Tukule Analytics Pipeline** automates the process of:
- **Data Ingestion**: Pulling data from Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Processing the data in Google Colab.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the transformed data in Looker Studio.

The pipeline is scheduled to run every 5 hours using GitHub Actions.
